# API Coding Challenge

This is a Shopify App built on top of the ISRC Spotify search API challenge. The app was created from Shopify's CLI tool and is built using:
Express
React
PostgreSQL

Functionality of the differing API endpoints can be tested on the homepage of the app. After installing the packages, you'll need to set up a .env file based on the example file.
